### ü§î Why BoCoEL?

Evaluating large language models are expensive and slow, and the size of modern datasets are gigantic. If only there is a way to just select a meaningful subset of the corpus and obtain a highly accurate evaluation.....

Wait, sounds like [Bayesian Optmization](#bayesian-optimization)!

This library encodes

### üöÄ Features

- üéØ Accurately evaluate large language models with just tens of samples from your selected corpus.
- üíÇ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Uses the power of Bayesian optimization to select an optimal set of samples for language model to evaluate.
- üíØ Evalutes the corpus on the model in addition to evaluating the model on corpus.
- ü§ó Integration with huggingface [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) and [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/index)
- üß© Modular design.

### üöß TODO: work in progress

- üìä Visualization module of the evaluation.
- üé≤ Integration of alternative methods (random, kmedoids...) with Gaussian process.

### Bayesian Optimization

Simply put, Bayesian optimization aims to optimize either the exploration objective (the purple area in the image) or the exploitation object (the height of the black dots). It uses Gaussian processes as a backbone for inference, and uses an **acquisition function** to decide where to sample next. See [here](https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/) for an a more in-depth introduction.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

I don't want optional dependencies:

```
pip install bocoel
```

Give me the full experience (all optional dependencies):

```
pip install "bocoel[all]"
```
